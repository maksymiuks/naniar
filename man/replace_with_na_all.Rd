\title{Replace all values with NA where a certain condition is met}
\usage{
replace_with_na_all(data, condition)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe}

\item{condition}{A condition required to be TRUE to set NA. Here, the condition
is specified with a formula, following the syntax: \verb{~.x \{condition\}}.
For example, writing \code{~.x < 20} would mean "where a variable value is less
than 20, replace with NA".}
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe and replaces all values that meet the
condition specified as an NA value, following a special syntax.
}
